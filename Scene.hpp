		std::string name;

		//The core function of a transform is to store a transformation in the world:
		glm::vec3 position = glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
		glm::quat rotation = glm::quat(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); //n.b. wxyz init order

		Transform *parent = nullptr;

		//It is often convenient to construct matrices representing this transformation:
		// ..relative to its parent:
		glm::mat4x3 make_local_to_parent() const;
		glm::mat4x3 make_parent_to_local() const;
		// ..relative to the world:
		glm::mat4x3 make_local_to_world() const;
		glm::mat4x3 make_world_to_local() const;

		//since hierarchy is tracked through pointers, copy-constructing a transform  is not advised:
		Transform(Transform const &) = delete;
		//if we delete some constructors, we need to let the compiler know that the default constructor is still okay:
		Transform() = default;

	//The "draw" function provides a convenient way to pass all the things in a scene to OpenGL:

	// throws on file format errors
	void load(std::string const &filename,
		std::function< void(Scene &, Transform *, std::string const &) > const &on_drawable = nullptr

	//empty scene:

	//load a scene:
	Scene(std::string const &filename, std::function< void(Scene &, Transform *, std::string const &) > const &on_drawable);

	//copy a scene (with proper pointer fixup):
	Scene(Scene const &); //...as a constructor
	Scene &operator=(Scene const &); //...as scene = scene
	//... as a set() function that optionally returns the transform->transform mapping:
